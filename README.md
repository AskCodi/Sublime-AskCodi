## Team learning
With the support of teams, you can accelerate the process by sharing suggestions with your team or the community. Ask Codi extension is integrated along with webapp version. Any code generated is reflected in the codebase. You can change the workspace from the webapp for the extension and segregate your codebase.

## Installation

1. Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

2. In Sublime, press `ctrl+shift+p`(Windows, Linux) or `cmd+shift+p`(OS X).

3. Type `install`, then press `enter` with `Package Control: Install Package` selected.

4. Type `askcodi`, then press `enter` with the `AskCodi` plugin selected.

5. Follow the sign-in process to authenticate your device..

6. Use Sublime and Codi will be ready to pair program with you. Your code generated will be in your codebase that can be explored in [Webapp](https://app.askcodi.com).


## Usage

**1. Generate Code:** Write your query as comment or statement. Select the query, right click and go to Ask Codi. Click on Generate Code and wait for bottom panel to open and display the results.

**2. Document Code:** Select the code, right click and go to Ask Codi. Click on Document Code and wait for bottom panel to open and display the results.

**3. Test Code:** Select the code, right click and go to Ask Codi. Click on Test Code and wait for bottom panel to open and display the results.

**3. Complete Code:** Complete code can be triggered using jot keys `ctrl + 1` only. Whether you are writing a statement or code, complete code can be triggered directly using the hot key to complete the code or even comments.

**4. Explain Code:** Select the code, right click and go to Ask Codi. Click on Explain Code and a bottom dialogue box opens. Keep the default text as it is to get the time complexity of the selected code. Delete and either provide a different information if you want(like a library)or leave it empty, and hit enter to get code explanation. Wait for bottom panel to open and display the results.


## How it works

1. AskCodi uses OpenAI GPT3 to generate suggestions.

2. For the context, Codi uses 512 characters before the selected query, or position of cursor/caret and uses that code to provide relavant suggestions. Please note, AskCodi does not save this context, however it is recommended that you do not include any sensitive data in the context or query.

3. The generated suggestion and query is saved on AskCodi servers to provide a codebase feature, which is only visible to the user(s) in the workspace they authenticated their device with. Only in case you chose "Community" workspace, it is visible to rest of the community.
